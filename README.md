# Developing Advanced Plots with Matplotlib [Video]
This is the code repository for [Developing Advanced Plots with Matplotlib [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/developing-advanced-plots-matplotlib-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788627825), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Matplotlib is a multi-platform data visualization tool built upon the Numpy and Scipy frameworks. One of Matplotlib’s most important features is its ability to work well with many operating systems and graphics backends. In this video course, you’ll get hands-on with customizing your data plots with the help of Matplotlib. You’ll start with customizing plots, making a handful of special-purpose plots, and building 3D plots. You’ll explore non-trivial layouts, Pylab customization, and more on tile configuration. You’ll be able to add text, put lines in plots, and also handle polygons, shapes, and annotations. Non-Cartesian and vector plots are exciting to construct, and you’ll explore them further in this tutorial. You’ll delve into niche plots and visualizing ordinal and tabular data.
In this video, you’ll be exploring 3D plotting, one of the best features when it comes to 3D data visualization, along with Jupyter Notebook, widgets, and creating movies for enhanced data representation. Geospatial plotting will be also be explored. Finally you’ll learn how to create interactive plots with the help of Jupyter. By the end of this video tutorial, you’ll be able to construct advanced plots with additional customization techniques and 3D plot types.
